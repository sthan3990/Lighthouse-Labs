/* 
For this challenge, we'll need to implement a function called judgeVegetable()that will decide which vegetable is best based on a given judging characteristic. Our function will receive two parameters: a list of veggies(as an array of objects), and a characteristic to judge the veggies by (in the case of a tomato, either redness or plumpness).

Our function must return the name of the person who submitted (vegetables.submitter) the vegetable with the highest ranking in the provided category. */

    submitter: 'Old Man Franklin',

    redness: 2,
    plumpness: 8

  {
    submitter: 'Hamid Hamidson',
    redness: 4,
    plumpness: 3
